## Predicting Credit Risk

Credit risk, the likelihood of a borrower failing to repay a loan or credit facility, is a critical concern in finance. Financial institutions invest heavily in mitigating this risk to safeguard their investments. The 2008 global financial crisis was largely attributed to the extension of mortgage loans to borrowers with poor credit scores, resulting in increased default rates during the recession.

### Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to estimate the probability of a client defaulting on a loan.


### Methodology

The project will follow these key steps:

1. **Data Preparation and Pre-processing**: This phase involves cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data quality.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA aims to understand the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and uncover insights through statistical analysis and visualizations.

3. **Feature Engineering and Selection**: Features will be engineered or selected based on their relevance to predicting credit risk. This step involves transforming or creating new features to improve model performance.

4. **Model Development and Evaluation**: Various machine learning algorithms will be trained on the prepared data to predict credit risk. Model performance will be evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess accuracy and generalization.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning model parameters to optimize performance and improve predictive accuracy.

### Conclusion

By systematically analyzing and modeling credit risk, financial institutions can make informed decisions to mitigate potential losses and maintain a healthy lending portfolio. This project aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance risk management practices in the financial sector.
